# ⏱️ Focus Tracking with Pomodoro

This repository documents my daily Pomodoro sessions as part of my productivity system.  
Each session is linked to deep work on AI/ML learning, portfolio building, and real-world projects like medical image classification.

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Tracking focus helps me:
- Stay consistent while transitioning into AI
- Maintain flow during technical projects
- Build visibility into how I spend my time

## 🗂️ Log Format

Each log includes:
- Date
- Task
- Category (`learning`, `portfolio`, `personal`)
- Pomodoro count
- Focus score (%)
- Interruptions

## 🔗 Example Projects Tracked
- [Cardiac MRI Classification](https://github.com/zi-bou/cardiac-mri-classification)
- Portfolio setup and Git version control
